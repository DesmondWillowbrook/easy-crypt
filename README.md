# Easy-crypt
A probably not-secure website built in an afternoon (and I really do mean _one_) to keep text secret.

I am **not** proud of this code, but it's so simple that it works. (probably)

Have a read through the code before using to check for any glaring flaws. (and file an issue if you find any, it's the polite thing to do.)
